# Objectives
# Create if statements using these logical conditionals below. Each statement should print information to the screen depending on if the condition is met.

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b

a = 33
b = 200
if a < b:
    print("a is less than b")


# Create an if statement using a logical conditional of your choice and include elif keyword that executes when other conditions are not met.
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")

# Create an if statement that includes both elif and else to execute when both if and elif are not met.
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")


# Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

# Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

# Create an if statement with two conditions by using and between conditions.

# Create an if statement with two conditions by using or between conditions.

# Create a nested if statement.

# Create an if statement that includes pass to avoid errors.
